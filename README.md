## Usage & Functionality

The functionality available in this application:

- Results are returned without refreshing the page and displayed as lists
- Results are paginated so that only 10 results per page are shown
- When the user hits the browser back button, they are taken back to their previous search

## Reflection

The aim of this project was to build an application that enables users to search for Sky Help Articles within a 2 hour limit - testing my client-side JavaScript and front end skills.

What went well?
- Worked well under pressure of limited time
- Able to quickly prioritise the ordering of development tasks
- Testing through development made the process much more efficient

Challenges faced during this project that made it a good learning experience?
- The 2 hour time limit meant I had to prioritise certain tasks over others, most of my focus was spent building the functionality leaving myself with a slot to do the styling at end.
- Limited time meant I had to get the functions right and reduce risk of issues in the code - Following a TDD mindset of testing lines of code rather than blocks helped ensure efficient development.

Tools used to implement this project?
- Facebook's Create React App was used to initialise this project. The application has been built using React, JavaScript and CSS.

What could be improved?
- Improved styling of the application
- Back and forward buttons in the pagination as it may become out of control if there are too many results
